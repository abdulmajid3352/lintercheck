# Agent

## 7.57.0

### Known bugs

- ECS Fargate deployments may cause increases in RAM and CPU usage. For more information see https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/issues/27523.

### Prelude

Release on: 2024-09-09

-   Please refer to the [7.57.0 tag on integrations-core](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/master/AGENT_CHANGELOG.md#datadog-agent-version-7570) for the list of changes on the Core Checks

### Upgrade Notes

-   Update cURL to 8.9.1.
-   Update OpenSSL from 3.0.14 to 3.3.1 (on Linux and macOS).

### New Features

-   The <span class="title-ref">agent diagnose</span> command now includes a `--json` option to output the results in JSON format.
-   Add <span class="title-ref">integration</span> value for device metadata.
-   APM: In order to allow for automatic instrumentation to work in Kubernetes clusters that enforce a `Restricted` [Pod Security Standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted), which require all containers to explicitly set a `securityContext`, an option to configure a <span class="title-ref">securityContext</span> to be used for all `initContainers` created by the auto instrumentation has been added. | This can be done through the `DD_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INIT_SECURITY_CONTEXT` environment value, or `admission_controller.auto_instrumentation.init_security_context` configuration -in both cases a `json` string should be supplied.
-   Adds a <span class="title-ref">kube\_runtime\_class</span> tag to metrics associated with Kubernetes pods and their containers.
-   Expose the Agent's get host tags function to python checks using the new <span class="title-ref">datadog\_agent.get\_host\_tags</span> method.
-   Implement static allowlist of Kubernetes events to send by default. This feature is only enabled when `filtering_enabled` is set to `true` in the `kubernetes_apiserver` integration configuration.
-   Adds a new launcher to handle incoming logs from integtrations.
-   Add optional reverse DNS enrichment of private IP addresses to NDM NetFlow.
-   On Windows, the default value for the service inference feature is now enabled.

### Enhancement Notes

-   Turn on Orchestrator Explorer by default in the core agent
-   Added new source\_host tag to TCP/UDP logs to help users understand where their logs came from.
-   Added support to handling UDP/TCP Logs when running the containerized agent.
-   APM: Allow custom HTTP client to be provided when instantiating the trace-agent configuration. This feature is primarily intended for the OpenTelemetry exporter.
-   APM: Add default UDS listeners for traces (trace-agent) and dogstatsd (core-agent) on /var/run/datadog/apm.socket and /var/run/datadog/dsd.socket, respectively. These are used in the Single Step APM Instrumentation, improving the onboarding experience and minimizing the agent configuration.
-   For the \[Inferred Service Dependencies beta\](<https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/guide/inferred-service-opt-in/?tab=java>), add two new <span class="title-ref">peer.hostname</span> precursor attributes, <span class="title-ref">out.host</span> and <span class="title-ref">dns.hostname</span>. This will improve coverage of inferred services because some tracer integrations only place the peer hostname in one of those attributes.
-   APM stats for internal service overrides are now aggregated by the <span class="title-ref">\_dd.base\_service</span> tag only, enhancing visibility into specific base services.
-   Include spans with <span class="title-ref">span.kind=consumer</span> for aggregation of stats on peer tags.
-   IP address quantization on all peer tags is done the backend during ingestion. This change updates the Agent to apply the same IP address quantization. This reduces unnecessary aggregation that is currently done on raw IP addresses. And therefore, improves the aggregation performance of stats on peer tags.
-   APM: Add new setting to disable the HTTP receiver in the trace-agent. This setting should almost never be disabled and is only a convenience parameter for OpenTelemetry extensions. Disabling the receiver is semantically equivalent to setting the receiver\_port to 0 and receiver\_socket to "".
-   Agents are now built with Go `1.22.6`.
-   \[NDM\] Adds the option to collect BGP neighbors metrics from Cisco SD-WAN.
-   \[NDM\] Add option to collect cloud application metrics from Cisco SD-WAN.
-   \[Cisco SD-WAN\] Allow enabling/disabling metrics collection.
-   Report the hostname of Kubernetes events based on the associated pod that the event relates to.
-   Introduces a parser to extract tags from integration logs and attach them to outgoing logs.
-   Implement External Data environment variable injection in the Admission Controller. Format for this new environment variable is <span class="title-ref">it-INIT\_CONTAINER,cn-CONTAINER\_NAME,pu-POD\_UID</span>. This new variable is needed for the New Origin Detection spec. It is used for Origin Detection in case Local Data are unavailable, for example with Kata Containers and CGroups v2.
-   Upgraded JMXFetch to [0.49.3](https://github.com/DataDog/jmxfetch/releases/0.49.3) which adds support for jsr77 j2ee statistics and custom ConnectionFactory. See [0.49.3](https://github.com/DataDog/jmxfetch/releases/tag/0.49.3) for more details.
-   Windows Agent Installer gives a better error message when a gMSA account is provided for `ddagentuser` that Windows does not recognize.
-   Uninstalling the Windows Agent MSI Installer removes specific subdirectories of the install path to help prevent data loss when `PROJECTLOCATION` is misconfigured to an existing directory.
-   Adds a default upper limit of 10000 to the number of network traffic paths that are captured at a single time. The user can increase or decrease this limit as needed.
-   Language detection can run on the core Agent without needing a gRPC server.
-   Add Hostname and ExtraTags to <span class="title-ref">CollectorECSTask</span>.
-   Collect SystemInfo for Pods and ECS Tasks.
-   Implement API that allows Python checks to send logs for eventual submission.
-   Users can use `DD_ORCHESTRATOR_EXPLORER_CUSTOM_SENSITIVE_ANNOTATIONS_LABELS` to remove sensitive annotations and labels. For example: `DD_ORCHESTRATOR_EXPLORER_CUSTOM_SENSITIVE_ANNOTATIONS_LABELS="sensitive-key-1 sensitive-key-2"`. Keys should be separated by spaces. The agent removes any annotations and labels matching these keys.
-   Add the ability to tag interface metrics with user-defined tags.

### Security Notes

-   Fix CVE-2024-41110.

### Bug Fixes

-   Results of <span class="title-ref">agent config</span> did not reflect the actual runtime config for the other services. This will have other Datadog Agent services (e.g. trace-agent) running as a systemd service read the same environment variables from a text file <span class="title-ref">/etc/datadog-agent/environment</span> as the core Agent process.
-   \[DBM\] Bump go-sqllexer to 0.0.13 to fix a bug where the table name is incorrectly collected on PostgreSQL SELECT ONLY statement.
-   \[Cisco SD-WAN\] Do not collect unspecified IP addresses.
-   Fix <span class="title-ref">container.net.\*</span> metrics accuracy on Linux. Currently <span class="title-ref">container.net.\*</span> metrics are always emitted with high cardinality tags while the values may not represent actual container-level values but POD-level values (multiple containers in a pod) or host-level values (containers running in host network). With this bug fix, the <span class="title-ref">container.net.\*</span> metrics aren't emitted for containers running in host network and a single timeseries is emitted by pods when running multiple containers. Finally, in non-Kubernetes environments, if multiple containers share the same network namespace, <span class="title-ref">container.net.\*</span> metrics won't be emitted.
-   Fix duplicate logging in Process Agent component's Enabled() method.
-   Fixed bug in kubelet check when running in core agent that was causing <span class="title-ref">kubernetes.kubelet.container.log\_filesystem.used\_bytes</span> to be reported by the check for excluded/non-existing containers. The metric was being reported in this case without tags. This bug does not exist in the python integration version of the kubelet check.
-   Fixes a bug on Windows in the driver installation custom actions that could prevent rollback from working properly if an installation failed or was canceled.
-   Update pro-bing library to include fix for a Windows specific issue with large ICMP packets
-   \[oracle\] Fix wrong durations for cloud databases.
-   Stop chunking outputs in manual checks for container, process, and process\_discovery checks to allow JSON unmarshaler to parse output.
-   Remove the original pod annotation on consul
-   Fix pod status for pods using native sidecars.
-   Fix a regression where the Agent would fail to start on systems with SysVinit.
-   APM: Fixes issue where the number of HTTP decoders was incorrectly set if setting GOMAXPROCS to milli-cpu values.

### Other Notes

-   Add metrics origins for vLLM integration.
-   Add deprecation warnings when running process checks on the Process Agent in Linux. This change prepares for the deprecation of processes and container collection in the Process Agent, occurring in a future release.
-   Add metric origin for the AWS Neuron integration
