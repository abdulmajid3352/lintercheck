      "text": "Moved the strict_dns, original_dst, logical_dns, static, and eds clusters to extensions. If you use these clusters and override extensions_build_config.bzl, you will now need to include them explicitly."

        "kind/breaking-change",
        "kind/upgrade-consideration",
        "impact/high"
      ],
      "text": "Removed the c-ares and apple resolvers as required extensions. Envoy now creates DNS resolvers only when necessary (e.g., for logical DNS clusters), so these resolvers are no longer required by default. If your Envoys perform DNS resolution and override extensions_build_config.bzl, you will need to explicitly include c-ares or the apple resolver."

      ],
      "text": "Fixed a bug in listeners where updates to fields like transparent, freebind, tcp_fast_open_queue_length, or socket_options were previously ignored. Now, when these fields are updated, a new socket will be created for the listener with the updated values if enable_reuse_port is true. If enable_reuse_port is false, the update will be rejected. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime flag envoy.reloadable_features.enable_update_listener_socket_options to false."

      ],
      "text": "Updated load balancing to ensure that when active health checking is enabled per cluster, slow start calculations begin after the first passing health check. The cluster membership duration condition has been removed from the slow start calculation, and endpoints can now re-enter slow start on each unhealthy to healthy transition if active health checking is configured per cluster."

      "text": "Fixed ext_authz metric tag extraction for stats in HTTP, ensuring stat_prefix is correctly extracted. The Prometheus metric name has changed from envoy_http_ext_authz_prefixval_denied{} to envoy_http_ext_authz_denied{envoy_ext_authz_prefix=\"prefixval\"}, with envoy_cluster_X_ext_authz_Y_denied following the same pattern."

This change can be temporarily reverted by setting the runtime flag envoy_reloadable_features_http_filter_avoid_reentrant_local_reply to false."

      "label": [
        "kind/feature",
        "impact/medium"
      ],
      "text": "Changed StreamEncoderFilter::encode1xxHeaders to use its own enum class Http::Filter1xxHeadersStatus, rather than the general headers enum class, which lacked support for most use cases. This update also ensures encode1xxHeaders sends local replies without trailing 1xx headers afterward."

        "kind/feature",
        "impact/medium"
      ],
      "text": "Adjusted the refetch time for remote_jwks in jwt_authn with the async_fetch feature. For successful fetches, the system now refetches 5 seconds before the JWKS cache duration expires. For failed fetches, the refetch time can be specified using failed_refetch_duration, which defaults to 1 second."

Peer certificates issued by an intermediate CA will now be trusted by building a valid partial chain, even without trusting the ancestor root CA.
