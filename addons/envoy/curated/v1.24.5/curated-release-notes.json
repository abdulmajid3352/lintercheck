      "text": "Fixed an issue where Envoy, when configured with ext_authz, ext_proc, tap, ratelimit filters, and gRPC access log service, would generate an invalid protobuf message when receiving an HTTP header with non-UTF-8 data, causing errors in the receiving service. Envoy now sanitizes non-UTF-8 values in gRPC service calls, replacing invalid data with a ‘!’ character. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting the runtime guard envoy.reloadable_features.service_sanitize_non_utf8_strings to false."
