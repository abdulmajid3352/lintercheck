      "text": "Fixed resource tracking when using the Incremental (Delta-xDS) protocol. The protocol state is now updated after the resources are successfully ingested and an ACK is sent.

For HTTP pools, set idle_timeout to limit the duration of upstream connections (default is 1h, recommended is 5min).
