      "text": "Modified WebSocket behavior to consider only a 101 status code as a successful response for a WebSocket handshake in HTTP/1.1. Envoy will now proxy the response header from upstream to downstream and close the request if any other status is received. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime flag envoy_reloadable_features_check_switch_protocol_websocket_handshake."
