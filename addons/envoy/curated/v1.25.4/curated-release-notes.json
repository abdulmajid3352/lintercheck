      "text": "Fixed an issue where Envoy, when configured with ext_authz, ext_proc, tap, ratelimit filters, and gRPC access log service, would generate an invalid protobuf message if an HTTP header with non-UTF-8 data was received. The receiving service would typically generate errors when decoding the message, potentially leading to unforeseen issues such as missing request logs. Envoy now sanitizes the values sent in gRPC service calls to ensure they are valid UTF-8, replacing invalid characters with a ‘!’ character. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting the runtime guard envoy.reloadable_features.service_sanitize_non_utf8_strings to false."
