## IMPORTANT NOTE

There is a bug affecting this release when deleted resources trigger a deletion of TXT records. This could impact deletions, but not additions when upgrading from any previous version to v0.12.0. In case you have problems, you can either create the records manually or downgrade. A fix is being worked in https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/pull/2811.
