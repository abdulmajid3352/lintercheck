source: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.8.1

Overall status: RECOMMENDED
Cautions
If you don't have the GRPCRoute CRD installed at all, Linkerd will run without GRPCRoute support. If you add the CRD after starting Linkerd, you'll need to restart the control plane for Linkerd to be able to use GRPCRoutes.

Changes
This release makes GRPCRoute optional: if you don't have the GRPCRoute CRD installed, Linkerd will run without any GRPCRoute functionality rather than failing to start. It also improves the status text when an HTTPRoute is incorrectly configured with parentRef pointing to a headless service, to make this situation easier to debug, and makes certain that trace-level logs honor proxy.logHTTPHeaders.
