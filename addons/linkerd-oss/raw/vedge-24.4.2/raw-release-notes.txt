source: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.4.2


Overall Status: No longer recommended
Cautions
edge-24.4.4 contains an important fix for a Gateway API issue, so we recommend it instead of this release.

Changes
This edge release fixes an issue where the service mirror controller would panic if it encountered an error listing mirror services while fixing its list of endpoints, and continues work on upcoming IPv6 support. It also allows correctly setting policy controller resources via Helm, instead of just defaulting them to the same as the destination controller (thanks, Grigoriy Mikhalkin!), allows relabeling metrics to customize how high-cardinality metrics get handled (thanks, Heiko Voigt!), and does a little cleanup of documentation in the code (thanks, hanghuge!). Finally, it adds a new linkerd diagnostics profile command which gives low-level visibility into which ServiceProfile is attached to a given address.
