Overall status: RECOMMENDED
Cautions
This release includes one breaking change: the proxy's /shutdown endpoint is now disabled by default. See Changes for how to reenable it.

Changes
This release disables the proxy's /shutdown endpoint by default; it can be reenabled by using --set proxy.enableShutdownEndpoint=true when installing or upgrading. Beyond that, it fixes several bugs: EndpointSlices with no hostname field are supported (thanks, Adrian Callejas!), DNS resolution errors are correctly logged (and the resolver's log level can be configured), the proxy's administration endpoints function correctly on systems using IPv4-mapped IPv6, and the init container and CNI plugin will not attempt to start on systems that configure IPv6 but don't support ip6tables. Finally, it supports controlling whether or not HTTP headers are logged in debug output (with the default being "not"), JSON output for the link, unlink, allow, and allow-scrapes CLI commands, and fixes a typo in the output of linkerd diagnostics (thanks, John Howard!)
