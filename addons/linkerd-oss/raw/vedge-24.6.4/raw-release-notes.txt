Overall status: RECOMMENDED
Cautions
It's no longer possible or necessary to explicitly set proxy-init's resource requests or limits; see the Changes section for more information.

Changes
This release changes the proxy-init container to always request the same amount of memory and CPU as the proxy itself, and removes the ability to explicitly set proxy-init's requests because there's now no need to do so. (This doesn't increase the resources required for the pod as a whole, because the proxy-init container completes before the proxy starts, letting the proxy reuse resources requested by the proxy-init container.) It also continues work on upcoming GRPCRoute support. Finally, if proxy.logHTTPHeaders is somehow empty, it correctly defaults to "off".
