Overall Status: RECOMMENDED
Cautions
None.

Changes
This edge release fixes support for native sidecars in the Linkerd CNI plugin, continues work on upcoming IPv6 support, and allows setting revisionHistoryLimit when installing with Helm to specify how many ReplicaSets to keep around for rollback purposes (thanks, Ilia Lazebnik!)

It also allows setting certain HTTP/2 server parameters using environment variables in the proxy container (see proxy PR 2924 if you think you need this!).
