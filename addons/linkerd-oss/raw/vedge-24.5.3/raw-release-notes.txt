Overall status: RECOMMENDED, but see Cautions
Cautions
If you use the Linkerd CNI plugin on GKE, you will need to disable IPv6 or use edge-24.5.5 instead.

Changes
This release removes an internal limit on the number of concurrent gRPC streams to the control plane, leaving available memory as the only constraint.
