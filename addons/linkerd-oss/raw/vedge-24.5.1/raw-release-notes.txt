source: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.5.1


Overall status: NOT RECOMMENDED; use edge-24.5.5 instead
Cautions
This release introduced a bug that prevents Linkerd from functioning on GKE with the default configuration; we recommend edge-24.5.5 instead. Additionally, this release has one breaking change: the patchs metric introduced in edge-24.3.4 is now correctly named patches.

Changes
This release adds configurable HTTP/2 server keepalives, fixes CLI issues and opaque-port issues when using native sidecars (issue #12395), restores Server v1beta1 to ease migrations after it was mistakenly removed in edge-24.1.2, fixes an issue that could cause the endpoints gauge to report incorrect numbers of endpoints, and continues ongoing work on upcoming IPv6 support.

Additionally, it avoids unnecessary cleanup of headless endpoint mirrors during garbage collection (thanks, Marwan Ahmed!) and cleans up some documentation in the code (thanks, knowmost!).
